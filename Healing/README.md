Racism creates this toxic space and those affected need to heal from it.  We need to make time and space for this emotional work to occur.   

This directory should serve as a repository for documents you gather for healing from anti-Black racism. Start with the resources found at https://www.particlesforjustice.org/resources, https://www.shutdownstem.com/healing, and https://www.vanguardstem.com
