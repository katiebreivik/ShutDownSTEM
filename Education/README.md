# EDUCATION

If this is new to you, start reading the materials gathered here: https://www.particlesforjustice.org/resources and shutdownstem.com/resources. These resources exist and you need to learn from them. Keep learning by reading books and blogs, watching movies, listening to podcast and following the suggested people on social media. If you draw from these resoures, include these organizations in an acknowledgement and citation of their work! 

This directory is designed to gather links to resources that our group/department/organization has found.

Every addition to this folder should contain a direct citation to the source of the information, the person who found it, and a description of why this resource is important to ShutDownSTEM
