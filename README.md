# ShutDownSTEM

Your racism is unique to you and your narrative. You need to do the work to get out of it. 
You were not born with the ability to code. You learned it. You can learn this.

Use this repository to organize your Strike4BlackLives when you #ShutDownSTEM and #ShutDownAcademia on June 10, 2020 and beyond.
